# Sequence Sorter and Visualizer

## About
This is a proof-of-concept project for sorting a sequence of random numbers using selected algorithm. Each step is rendered
and displayed in a Windows Form window in realtime.

The program is extendable with additional algorithms as long as they implement the `ISortingAlgorithm` interface.


## Future Improvements
* More sorting algorithms
* Better realtime drawing, possibly using something else than Windows Forms
* Make a user interface for controlling the application
